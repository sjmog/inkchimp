InkChimp
========

Mailchimp-optimised templates based off ZURB's magical Ink framework.

- Zurb did a good thing with their wonderful [Ink responsive email template framework](http://zurb.com/ink/)
- Mailchimp do a good thing with their mega [Mailchimp email campaign framework](http://www.mailchimp.com)
- We're gonna bind them together.

What do I do?
============

Fork it, use it, improve it, PR it. Bonus points for templates that make creative use of [Mailchimp Merge Tags](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/all-the-merge-tags-cheatsheet).

Please bear in mind you're coding email, so none of this CSS rubbish:

- Positioning
- Floats
- Anything remotely complex

Basically, if it was introduced post-1996, don't use it. Simples.
